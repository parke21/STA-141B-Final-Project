The aim of this project is to determine if there are certain musical features that have changed over the past 10 year in the top 100 most popular song. To achieve this goal, this code scrapes data from the Billboard top 100 charts from the years 2014 to 2023 and creates a data frame. It then uses Spotify's API to request song-specific data features and graphs the average of each feature over time.
